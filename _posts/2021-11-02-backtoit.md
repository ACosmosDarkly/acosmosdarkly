excerpt: "I'm back with a new website"

A few months ago I said that I'd be posting more as soon as I found the time to do so. Well the wait is over, and I am finally going to start including write-ups for HackTheBox and more. It's my intention to post things here as a way to explain what I've been working on, not only for others to hopefully learn something from me, but to solidify this knowledge in my own mind. The best ways I've found that I learn and retain information is by doing it and writing it down in my own words as I go along. As I write it down I try to do it in a way so that it is not only understood by myself, but also so that hopefully others can grasp it.

That's what I'm doing here and why I've decided to spend so much time trying to figure out how to establish my own page. I used a new template for my site because the old site was not scalable enough for my purposes. Hopefully now I can spend less time on managing the page itself, and more time actually posting new book summaries or write-ups. That's where it stands now, so be on the lookout for new content!
