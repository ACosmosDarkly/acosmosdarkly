excerpt: Doom's 30th birthday
---

Doom turns 30 this Sunday, December 10th, and in celebration of that milestone, I'm going to list some of my all-time favorite mods and WADs. I started playing Doom on my aunt's Windows 95 computer during my grade school years, and it has since evolved into my most treasured and frequently played video games. The number of mods that the community has created makes this a game that never becomes outdated. Moreover, Doom has received a few updated games since then with Doom 3 back in the early 2000s, Doom (2016), and Doom Eternal and DLCs The Ancient Gods Part 1 and 2.

I also want to give a shoutout to Half-Life, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. I believe it's equally influential for its role in shaping modern-day video games. Where Doom reshaped the FPS overall, Half-Life transformed storytelling and world-building in video games and Half-Life: Alyx finally made virtual reality seem like more than a novelty or gimmick. 

However, I digress. Where Doom shines is not solely in the official releases, but in the modding community and the artists who continue to create add-ons and entirely new games from this historic title. Without further ado, here are my personal favorites from the past 30 years.

## [Prodoomer](https://www.moddb.com/mods/prodoomer-v3)

Prodoomer is a total conversion mod, meaning it significantly alters some or all major aspects of the original game. This mod features 33 maps, a leveling system, boss fights, and character upgrades, making the game feel more like an RPG FPS than a straight shooter. Obviously, there is still plenty of shooting, but the addition of player levels, experience points, and the option to backtrack on levels from a central hub changes that experience. Some of the larger maps can be a bit tedious to clear, but I've spent hours in this game and look back on it fondly. Honestly, it's an excellent mod for those seeking a comprehensive redesign of the base game.

## [Doom Slayer Chronicles](https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-slayer-chronicles)
<img src="/images/posts/doom/DSC.png" width="500">

I can't quite recall where I first came across this mod. Unlike Prodoomer, it isn't a total conversion, but rather a map pack that, in some ways, feels like one. The game showcases some of the most insane looking maps I've ever seen come out of a Doom mod. It's been a while since I last played it, but I recall it feeling something akin to Dante's Inferno, where you delve deeper into the abyss. The maps take you through graveyards, cathedrals, UAC facilities, and the very plains of Hell itself. As a "simple" map pack, this mod is typically compatible with gameplay mods that I'll discuss like Brutal Doom and Complex Doom, elevating the gameplay to new heights. I highly recommend this mod for its extraordinary detail and the intense, dark atmosphere.

## [Brutal Doom](https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom)

One does not simply talk about Doom and not give Brutal Doom it's due recognition. Brutal Doom is a gameplay enhancement mod that changes some aspects of the game in a substantial way, but not completely like a total conversion. This makes it incompatible with some mods, but generally map WADs are fine to use. Brutal Doom adds sounds, weapons, weapon skins, player and demon interactions, and new styles of combat to make Doom even more... brutal. There is also a "Black Edition" that makes the game even more realistic and difficult for those who seek even more out of this already epic mod.

## [Live Through Doom (LiT Doom)](https://www.moddb.com/mods/litdoom-survival-gameplay)
<img src="/images/posts/doom/litdoom.jpg" width="500">

Brutal Doom Black Edition might require tactics and strategy to navigate the added realism, but LiT Doom is a straight-up survival horror FPS. Live Through Doom is another gameplay enhancement mod that adds a completely new feel to how Doom is played. The straightforward run-and-gun approach is no longer viable. This mod adds stamina, bleeding, poison, and realism that mean you can no longer afford to be shot, burned, scratched, or bitten without serious repercussions. It also incorporates crafting mechanics, allowing players to create items such as bandages for healing, various stimulants for character buffs, and even ammunition crafting and weapon repair. I return to LiT Doom when I feel like I need something more than the base Doom experience, and it delivers a challenge every time.

## [Complex Doom and Legendary Complex Addon and....](https://www.moddb.com/mods/complex-doom)
<img src="/images/posts/doom/lcfd.png" width="500">

What do I even say about this mod? It's a phenomenal partial conversion that introduces a vast array of new enemies and weapons. The sheer volume of additional *everything* put into this mod makes it one of the absolute best mods out there. It features formidable enemies - legendary, enraged legendary, nemesis, and vexed nemesis - that will absolutely wreck you if you don't have the right equipment (and sometimes even if you do). Moreover, the mod features epic music, a diverse array of formidable enemies, innovative weapons, and tiered monster levels to prevent immediate overwhelming of players. This mod remains one of my all-time favorites; its replay value is outstanding, and I find myself returning to it time and again. The variety of mods that come with this pack are partially playable with GZDoom, but they play best on for the Zandronum source port for which they are made.

## [Myhouse.wad](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134292-myhousewad/)
<img src="/images/posts/doom/myhouse.jpg" width="500">

Don't let the quaint image fool you, this is a horror mod of epic proportions. Released in March 2023 this map quickly became one of the most popular and talked about mods in the community. I could fill an entire post just talking about this WAD, but I'll save you the details and say that it starts with a story about the passing of a friend and reminiscing about their friendship. The game quickly turns from curiosity, to unease, to completely unhinged in short order. When you play it you just get further and further into the rabbit hole, and then come to find out the damn hole just keeps going! I still need to go back to this mod and find the pieces I am still missing despite at least 15 playthroughs. No need to add gameplay enhancements to this WAD. It stands alone.

## [Ancient Aliens](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/87784-ancient-aliens-final-version-on-idgames/)
<img src="/images/posts/doom/aa.jpg" width="500">

Moving on to more map only mods, this is a 32-level megawad containing unique, surprising, and colorful levels replete with hellspawn. This wad will many times force you into situations where you have to run rather than fight, at least initially. It includes two new enemies that don't typically add a whole lot to the game in my opinion, but can become buggy when adding certain gameplay mods. I play this map pack frequently for its expansive and unique level designs, relative difficulty, and the overarching story that keeps things interesting.

## [Back to Saturn X](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/megawads/btsx_e1)
<img src="/images/posts/doom/b2s.jpg" width="500">

Back to Saturn X is a well-known series of megawads, of which I've only so far played episode 2. Each episode contains about 28 levels each with unique designs and original music. Maps contain everything from large and target-rich environments to small, quiet hallways that keep you guessing as to what is going to happen next. Some build previews were recently released for the third and final episode which I assume will contain an approximately equal number of levels, making this series a mammoth megawad series. 

## 30 Years of Doom

I'm going to stop my list here, but this isn't to say this is all there is. Mods exist to change every aspect of the game or add to it including the addition of shaders, new HUDs, 3D voxel models, weapon selection mods, lighting and colors, liquid textures, weapon-only mod packs, enemy redesigns, and the list keeps going. The Doom from the 90's continues to this day because of the modding community making it something you can keep coming back to over and over. I don't know what the next 30 years will bring, but one thing is certain: The Doom Slayer will be there, and Hell's coming with him.
