I want to say first and foremost, thanks to my wonderful wife who quite literally held the house together while I was locked away in my room for 24 weeks. Thank you sweetie!!!!

Alright, so a lot of you possibly (probably... maybe) know that I was in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering Computer Science Bridge (or Bridge to Computer Science?) program. Well, it was going well, but ultimately I ended up not making the cut. Not that I was *trying* to get into NYU, I wasn't, but the certificate would have helped my application to Georgia Tech. I'm not mad or defeated that I didn't pass. I learned so much from the program that it was definitely worth the time and cost. I don't want to downplay the difficulty of the program though. Our cohort started out with almost 500 people and ended with something like 289. I don't have the number in front of me, but it was something like half the class dropped within the first 12 weeks. I don't blame them, it hits you quickly that this program is going to take a metric fucking ton of work, and you have 30 days to get a refund.

For instance, I consider myself to be pretty good at studying, remembering, and taking exams. I studied for the CISSP for 2 months and passed on my first try. I had help from the fact that a lot of the material was covered in previously studied certifications, but it was still no joke. Compared to the NYU Bridge, the CISSP might as well have been a color by numbers. If you didn't have at a minimum 30 - 40 hours per week to sink into homework every week (as NYU states in their course description), then you had no hope. My first week I found out we had to start submitting assignments in a typed (.docx or .pdf) format. That's how I taught myself LaTeX while my computer was on fire, I was on fire, everything was on fire, and I was in hell. Honestly though, I couldn't have done it without our cohort, more on them at the end for a proper sendoff.

If you think NYU bridge might be right for you, ask yourself the following questions:
1. Do I hate free time and knowing what the outdoors feels like?
2. Do I enjoy the feeling of dread that comes from knowing that there will never be enough hours in the day to study everything. 
3. Do you have a family and friends? Not anymore!

I jest, and I don't want to discourage anyone, but I want you to understand what you're getting yourself into. I was in the 24-week program (not the 17-week program like some lunatics), I already had some knowledge of programming like if/else statements, switch statements, classes, some data structures, data types, I work in IT and have a B.S. in Cybersecurity, and I was taking math courses on Khan Academy. I still couldn't make the grade to pass. If I hadn't had at least that much I probably would have failed long before I did.

As of now I'm taking some math and programming basics at a local community college to meet the requirement to apply for the OMSCS at Georgia Tech. The math is that hardest part because I didn't make it far in high school or my last two undergraduate degrees. What's funny is I was doing "computer science math" during bridge, but the college wants me to take THREE prerequisites before I can take their CS math course *eye roll*. 

I guess that's about all there is to it. I'll get there eventually, the bridge was a good experience, and I just need to keep moving along. Last but not least of course is our 2022 winter bridge cohort. I got a lot of help from our questions and conversations, and I couldn't have done a lot of it without their help. To say I "taught myself" would be leaving out their contribution. They were out there splitting the atom while I was in a cave banging rocks together trying to get a fire going. I'm definitely glad I was in this group. They were all rock stars, and given another chance I'd still put myself through this!
