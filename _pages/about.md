Greetings and welcome. My name is Gabriel Penner and I am an information technology/security professional with blue team aspirations. The majority of my career so far has been working as a system administrator, but I've spent a lot of my spare time working on information security related projects. I eventually decided to create this website as a place to share thoughts about the books I'm reading and projects I'm working on. It's also a place of learning for myself, since doing a project and then writing about it for others solidifies that knowledge. 

I enjoy learning new things on just about any subject, but my first and greatest love has always been astronomy, cosmology, and astrophysics (basically anything involving SPAAAAAAACE!). In another life I may have chosen to pursue that field, but it has certainly been a part of who I am since I was able to hold a book. Outside of study and reading I also play guitar and piano, work on various wood working projects, and generally just enjoy spending time with family and friends.
