I am an information technology/security professional with blue team aspirations. The majority of my career so far has been working as a system administrator, but I've spent a lot of my spare time working on information security related projects. I eventually decided to create this website as a place to share thoughts about the books I'm reading and projects I'm working on. It's also a place of learning for myself, since doing a project and then writing about it for others solidifies that knowledge. 

I try my hand at many different things, but my main interests are all things science (but specifically astronomy/space stuff), reading, history, music, and art.
